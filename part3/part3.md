1. The bug was that instead of calculating the sum of the two input values, the function returns the concatenation of the two values because num1 and num2 are being passed into the calculateSum function as strings.
2. I would fix this issue by converting the values of num1 and num2 using the parseInt() function. See fix.PNG
